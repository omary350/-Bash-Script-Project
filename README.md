Database Management Systeem Using Bashscript
This projejct aims to simulates the DBMS operations that most of existed DBMS do like: MySql, Microsoft Sql Server, etc...
the DBMS in our project is cabaple of:
1- create databases as directoris. 
2- drop datebase.
3- connect to database. 
4- list existed databases.

when connecting to databases you can do most of database operations on tables like:
1- create table (tables is files inside database directory).
2- list tables in current database.
3- insert data in table.
4- select data from table with multiple option for selection.
5- update table data with multiple options for updating.
6- delete data form table with multiple options for deleteing.

All user input goes through validation processes to check if input is meeting the DBMS requirements.

To run this project you need to open terminal in project directory and type bash myMoha.dbms.sh

thank you.
