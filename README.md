This project aims to simulate the operations of a database management system (DBMS) similar to popular ones like MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server. 

Our DBMS project is capable of the following:

1-Creating databases as directories.

2-Dropping databases.

3-Connecting to databases.

4-Listing existing databases.

When connecting to databases, you can perform various operations on tables, such as:

1-Creating tables (where tables are represented as files inside the database directory).

2-Listing tables in the current database.

3-Inserting data into a table.

4-Selecting data from a table with multiple options for filtering.

5-Updating table data with various update options.

6-Deleting data from a table using different deletion options.

All user input goes through validation processes to ensure it meets the DBMS requirements.

To run this project, open the terminal in the project directory and type bash myMoha.dbms.sh.

Thank you!
